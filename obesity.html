    <h2>The health risks of excess weight include:</h2>
   <ul>
  <li> a higher risk of diabetes</li>
  <li>  stroke </li>
   <li> certain types of cancer </li>
    </ul>
  <h2>  Weight control</h2>
Body weight control is much more successful if you can combine a well-balanced diet with regular exercise.<br>

Crash diets may have positive short-term results, but they tend to have poor long-term success rates.<br>

If you manage to sleep between 7 and 8 hours continuously in each 24 hour period, your body weight control will be more successful. Sleep deprivation or lack of sleep can make you put on weight.<br>

<br>
 Measures to prevent putting weight back on after losing it:
<br>
<br>
<b>Physical activity:</b>Do at least 200 minutes each week of moderate-intensity exercise. This should be spread out over at least three days (do not do all the minutes in one go each week).<br>
<b>Watching TV:</b> Limit your TV watching to no more than 10 hours each week. Many people might find this recommendation particularly difficult to follow.<br>
<b>Fat limit on diet:</b> Make sure that no more than 30% of your nutritional intake is in the form of fat.<br>
<b>Eat consistently:</b> Resist the urge to overeat during weekends and holidays. Your food intake should follow a regular routine. Overeating not only upsets your routine, it most likely impacts on your metabolism.<br>
<b>Breakfast:</b> Never miss it. Breakfast helps stave off hunger later on in the day, and this can help prevent overeating and snacking.<br>
<b>Monitor yourself:</b> Keep a close check on what you eat and regularly weigh yourself.<br>
