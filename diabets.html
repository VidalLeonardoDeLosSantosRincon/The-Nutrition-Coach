    <h2>For people who have diabetes, the key to a beneficial diet, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), is as follows:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Include fruits and vegetables.</li>
    <li>Eat lean protein.</li>
    <li>Choose foods with less added sugar.</li>
    <li>Avoid trans fats.</li>
</ul>
Below is a list of some fruits, vegetables, and foods with less added sugar.
<ol>
    <h3><li>Green leafy vegetables</li></h3>
    Green leafy vegetables are packed full of essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. They also have minimal impact on blood sugar levels.<br>
    Leafy greens, including spinach and kale, are a key plant-based source of potassium, vitamin A, and calcium. They also provide protein and fiber.
    <h3><li>Whole grains</li></h3>
    Whole grains contain high levels of fiber and more nutrients than refined white grains.<br>
    Eating a diet high in fiber is important for people with diabetes because fiber slows down the digestion process. A slower absorption of nutrients helps keep blood sugar levels stable.
    <h3><li>Fatty fish</li></h3>
    Fatty fish is a healthful addition to any diet. Fatty fish contains important omega-3 fatty acids called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
<br>
People need a certain amount of healthful fats to keep their body functioning and to promote heart and brain health.
    <h3><li>Beans</li></h3>
    Beans are an excellent food option for people with diabetes. They are source of plant-based protein, and they can satisfy the appetite while helping people reduce their carbohydrate intake.
<br>
Beans are also low on the GI scale and are better for blood sugar regulation than many other starchy foods.
    <h3><li>Walnuts</li></h3>
    Nuts are another excellent addition to the diet. Like fish, nuts contain healthful fatty acids that help keep the heart healthy.
<br>
Walnuts are especially high in omega-3 fatty acids called alpha-lipoic acid (ALA). Like other omega-3s, ALA is important for good heart health.
    <h3><li>Citrus fruits</li></h3>
    Research has shown that citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, and lemons, have antidiabetic effects.
<br>
Eating citrus fruits is a great way to get vitamins and minerals from fruit without the carbohydrates.
    <h3><li>Berries</li></h3>
    Berries are full of antioxidants, which can help prevent oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is linked with a wide range of health conditions, including heart disease and some cancers.
<br>
Studies have found chronic levels of oxidative stress in people with diabetes. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between antioxidants and unstable molecules called free radicals in the body.
    <h3><li>Sweet potatoes</li></h3>
    Sweet potatoes have a lower GI than white potatoes. This makes them a great alternative for people with diabetes, as they release sugar more slowly and do not raise blood sugar as much.
<h3><li>Probiotic yogurt</li></h3>
Probiotics are the helpful bacteria that live in the human gut and improve digestion and overall health.
<br>
Some research from 2011 suggested that eating probiotic yogurt could improve cholesterol levels in people with type 2 diabetes. This could help lower the risk of heart disease.
<h3><li>Chia seeds</li></h3>
People often call chia seeds a superfood due to their high antioxidant and omega-3 content. They are also a good source of plant-based protein and fiber.
<br>
In one small-scale randomized controlled trial from 2017, people who were overweight and had type 2 diabetes lost more weight after 6 months when they included chia seeds in their diet compared with those who ate an oat bran alternative.
