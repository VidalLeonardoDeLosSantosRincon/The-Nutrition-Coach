      <h2>Nutrients to focus on: </h2>
      <h3>Calcium</h3>
      This mineral is an important component of bone tissue.
      <h3>Vitamin D</h3> 
      This is your body’s companion vitamin to calcium. Without enough vitamin D, your body can’t absorb calcium properly.
    <h3>Protein</h3> 
    You need protein to maintain healthy tissues, including muscle tissue. Low protein intake is associated with increased risk for hip fracture. ResearchersTrusted Source recommend eating between 0.8 and 2.0 milligrams (mg) of protein per kilogram of body weight.
    <h3>Vitamin C</h3>
    Vitamin C enhances the absorption of calcium. When taken together, they can maximize bone strength and may play a role in preventing osteoporosis. Get plenty of vitamin C from fresh fruits and vegetables.
 <h3>Magnesium</h3>
 This mineral plays a role in building strong bones. However, your body’s ability to absorb magnesium diminishes with age. Eating a variety of healthy foods can help you get enough magnesium on a daily basis.
<h3>Vitamin K</h3>
Researchers have identified a relationship between vitamin K1 and osteoporosis: Women with lower vitamin K intakes were at greater risk for hip fracture. Those who got more than 254 mg per day had a significantly reduced risk for hip fractures.
<h3>Zinc</h3>
Your body uses zinc to help the bones stay strong. Low intakes of zinc are associated with poor bone health.
