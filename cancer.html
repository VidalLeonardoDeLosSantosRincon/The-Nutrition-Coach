    <h2>The Best Diets for Cancer Patients and Cancer Survivors</h2><br> <br>
    <p>A healthy diet can help prolong life for cancer patients and cancer survivors, says University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center member Suzanna Zick, N.D., MPH.</p>
 <h3>Paleolithic diet</h3> <br> 
 The Paleolithic diet attempts to replicate the dietary pattern of Stone Age humans — the hunter-gatherers who ate fruits, vegetables, nuts, meat and eggs — while excluding grains, legumes, dairy products and processed foods.<br> <br>

 Devotees believe chronic diseases such as cancer arise from the consumption of foods available only after the agricultural revolution. Humans, adherents say, are not genetically equipped to digest these foods.<br> <br>
 “It’s based on the belief that our ancestors had a superior diet,” Zick says.<br> <br>

 But strict adherence eliminates food groups, like beans and whole grains, proven to be beneficial for cancer prevention, decreasing cancer mortality and general health, she says.
 
 Also, she cites anthropological evidence that there is no single Paleolithic diet and that grains have been processed and consumed since Paleolithic times.
 
 This diet tends to have people eat too much red meat, she says, although it does emphasize whole foods, fruits and vegetables.
 <h3>Ketogenic diet</h3> <br> 
 The keto diet emphasizes a high-fat, low-carbohydrate meal plan, with 65 percent or more of calories coming from fat.<br> <br>

It works to shift the energy source of cancer cells away from glucose to ketones, Zick says.<br> <br>

The research is mixed on this, she says. Evidence suggests that some cancer cells appear less able to metabolize ketones compared with healthy cells, while other experiments show tumor cells use ketones for energy.<br> <br>
<h3>Vegan diet</h3><br>
The heart of the vegan diet is abstinence from eating animal products, such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey. It encourages so-called “cancer-fighting” foods, including berries, greens, whole grains, nuts and seeds.<br> <br>

But not everyone chooses those foods and there are many highly processed and sugar-filled vegan and vegetarian foods. “The problem is you can eat poorly while being a vegan or a vegetarian,” Zick says. Vegans often are low in calcium and vitamin B12 compared with omnivorous diets.<br> <br>
An analysis of several studies found that vegan diets are associated with a 15 percent reduction in total cancer incidence, but that figure stems from vegan followers who also exercised, partook in stress reduction and had a social support network in place, leaving scientists to wonder if the other factors influenced the drop.
<h3>Macrobiotic diet</h3><br>
Imbalance in the body can cause illness such as cancer, according to the Eastern philosophy behind a macrobiotic diet, Zick explains.  <br> <br>

Eating — and exercising and meditation — for balance and homeostasis is the goal, so the diet is predominantly vegetarian and emphasizes unprocessed, organic, whole foods. Cereal grains, like rice and millet, make up 40 to 60 percent of the diet, while vegetables and legumes split the rest. It is high in fiber and free of red or processed meat.<br> <br>

The diet was found to have a lower percentage of energy from fat, higher total dietary fiber, and higher amounts of most micronutrients than the Recommended Daily Allowance, with the exceptions of vitamin D, vitamin B12 and calcium, which were lower than the RDA, Zick says. It remains a good choice because it meets most of the dietary ACS and AICR guidelines.<br> <br>
